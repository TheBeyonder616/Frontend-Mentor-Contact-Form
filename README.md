## My Process

I developed a contact form component that includes input fields for first name, last name, email, query type, message, and terms agreement. The form features real-time validation with error messages and visual feedback to guide users through the submission process.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Employed modern HTML elements to structure the contact form, improving readability and accessibility.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Utilized CSS variables for color and font management, ensuring consistency and easy theming.
- **Flexbox and Grid:** Applied for layout and alignment to maintain a responsive design across different devices.
- **Responsive Design:** Used `clamp()` for fluid typography and media queries to adapt the layout to various screen sizes.
- **JavaScript:** Managed form validation and interactive feedback, including error handling and visual cues for form state.

### What I Learned

This project enhanced my skills in:

- **Form Validation:** Implementing client-side validation to ensure user inputs are correct before submission.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizing CSS techniques for creating layouts that work across a range of devices.
- **JavaScript Event Handling:** Effectively managing form interactions and dynamic updates.
- **Best Practices:** Organizing and structuring code for maintainability and performance.

### Continued Development

Future improvements will focus on:

- **Advanced Validation Techniques:** Incorporating more sophisticated validation rules and real-time feedback.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Ensuring the form is fully accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Refining the user experience with more interactive elements and improved visual design.
